# Forumspeakup
Forumspeakup is a forum site built using .Net Core, MVC and Entity Framework. In this forum, you can create posts by recording your voice, and you can respond to the created posts with voice or text. You can talk about specifically determined topics. And you can like or dislike the created posts. I made a project with this and many similar features.

## Forumspeakup Is Online!
You can visit the forum whenever you want. Just go to forumspeakup.com,
